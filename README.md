## writeups of my ropemporium solutions

I made this to document my solutions to [ROPEmporium](https://ropemporium.com/) and to hold myself accountable to solving all of them.

I know, I suck and I'm a horrible stupid idiot who should be doing way more advanced stuff than this. I think about that every single day and I always say I'm a huge waste of oxygen.
